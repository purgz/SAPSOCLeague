# SapsocLeague

Boilerplate generated using JHipster

Application developed for University Of Birmingham Pool and Snooker league to aid with the weekly leagues which are run. The application will be responsible for calculating and tracking results and scores for all members of the leagues, as well as displaying historical league data.
Also aims to introduce a new ELO style leaderboard system which will be continuous across multiple league semesters.

## Continous integration / deployment

Hosting using ngrok and free private domain
ngrok http --domain=normal-haddock-nearly.ngrok-free.app 9000 --host-header="localhost:9000"

GitHub actions CI pipeline created to run java:docker to generate and publish docker image to henrybrooks/sapsoc [docker registry].
CD pipeline to come in future with ngrok as a hosting mechanism.

## Using Docker to simplify development

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml up -d
```

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml down
```

## Dockerize full application

```
npm run java:docker
```

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d
```

- `.yo-rc.json` - Yeoman configuration file
  JHipster configuration is stored in this file at `generator-jhipster` key. You may find `generator-jhipster-*` for specific blueprints configuration.
- `.yo-resolve` (optional) - Yeoman conflict resolver
  Allows to use a specific action when conflicts are found skipping prompts for files that matches a pattern. Each line should match `[pattern] [action]` with pattern been a [Minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch#minimatch) pattern and action been one of skip (default if ommited) or force. Lines starting with `#` are considered comments and are ignored.
- `.jhipster/*.json` - JHipster entity configuration files

## Development

npm run start to launch frontend.
./mvnw to launch backend

### Using Angular CLI

You can also use [Angular CLI][] to generate some custom client code.

For example, the following command:

```
ng generate component my-component
```

will generate few files:

```
create src/main/webapp/app/my-component/my-component.component.html
create src/main/webapp/app/my-component/my-component.component.ts
update src/main/webapp/app/app.module.ts
```

## Building for production

### Packaging as jar

To build the final jar and optimize the SapsocLeague application for production, run:

```
./mvnw -Pprod clean verify
```

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

```
java -jar target/*.jar
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

Refer to [Using JHipster in production][] for more details.

### Packaging as war

To package your application as a war in order to deploy it to an application server, run:

```
./mvnw -Pprod,war clean verify
```

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

```
./mvnw verify
```

### Client tests

Unit tests are run by [Jest][]. They're located in [src/test/javascript/](src/test/javascript/) and can be run with:

```
npm test
```

For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

### Code quality

Sonar is used to analyse code quality. You can start a local Sonar server (accessible on http://localhost:9001) with:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

Note: we have turned off authentication in [src/main/docker/sonar.yml](src/main/docker/sonar.yml) for out of the box experience while trying out SonarQube, for real use cases turn it back on.

You can run a Sonar analysis with using the [sonar-scanner](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner) or by using the maven plugin.

Then, run a Sonar analysis:

```
./mvnw -Pprod clean verify sonar:sonar
```

If you need to re-run the Sonar phase, please be sure to specify at least the `initialize` phase since Sonar properties are loaded from the sonar-project.properties file.

```
./mvnw initialize sonar:sonar
```
